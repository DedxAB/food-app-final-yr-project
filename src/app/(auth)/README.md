# Group Routing in Our Application

## In our application, we use a concept called "Group Routing". This is a method of organizing our routes into logical and manageable groups.

### Here's how it works:

We declare a group route inside parentheses `()`. For instance, `(auth)`. It's important to note that `auth` is not a route itself. Rather, it's a directory. All the folders inside the `auth` directory are the actual routes.

This way, we can keep our routing clean and organized, making it easier for developers to navigate through the codebase.
